## Today's Objectives:

### 1. Frontend Development
- **Build Landing Page UI (page.tsx)**:
  - Centerpiece text: "Search" (styled prominently for AI search engine branding).
  - Ensure a clean, modern design with responsive styling.

- **Design Login Form**:
  - Include fields for username/email and password.
  - Add functionality for "Forgot Password" and "Sign Up" links.
  - Provide basic validation (e.g., required fields, email format).

### 2. Backend Setup
- **Initialize Backend Server**:
  - Set up a Node.js/Express server (or preferred backend framework).
  - Define routes for user authentication and search queries.
  - Prepare for integration with the semantic engine.

### 3. Technology Stack & Tools
- Frontend:
  - React (with TypeScript)
  - Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for styling
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express
  - Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
  - Authentication: JWT or OAuth2
- Semantic Search:
  - OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, or custom-trained embeddings
- Hosting & Deployment:
  - Vercel/Netlify for frontend
  - AWS/GCP/Heroku for backend

### 4. Search Engine UI
- **Design Search Interface**:
  - Input box for search queries.
  - Display results with relevance-based ranking.
  - Include filters (e.g., date, source type).

### 5. Build Semantic Engine
- **Semantic Search Integration**:
  - Implement vector-based search using tools like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.
  - Experiment with pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, SentenceTransformers).
  - Optimize for accuracy and speed.

### Optional Stretch Goals:
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Add dark mode.
  - Include animations for a polished user experience.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Support for multi-language search.
  - Voice input for search queries.

### Workflow Notes:
- Break tasks into smaller subtasks for efficiency.
- Ensure proper documentation and version control (Git/GitHub).
- Prioritize modular, reusable components.
